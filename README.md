Build an Android app written in Kotlin which uses REST API (https://gorest.co.in/public-api/todos) to download a list of todos and show them in a list. Use Ktor for REST requests.
Todos should be saved in local storage so users could read them with no network connection. Use Room for Database.
The items on the list should display titles of todos.
Tapping an item on the list should display a details screen with the title of the corresponding item and date when todo was updated. 
Use Conductor for navigation.
At least some components should be unit tested.
Focus on the scalable modular architecture.
